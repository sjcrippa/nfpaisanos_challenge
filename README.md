yarn dev

pnpm dev

bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Insights
For the development process, first, prepare the color palette and breakpoints within the Tailwind configuration, based on what is provided in the figma file.

Then, I focused on the layout of the entire website, taking into account the figma's instructions.

Once the layout was finished, I focused on the rendering and filtering logic. Then I built the context and added animations and micro-interactions to the project.

Como deuda tecnica quedaran los filtros por color, antiguedad y likes. Y tambien los sectores de item-detail y aunction-adding.
